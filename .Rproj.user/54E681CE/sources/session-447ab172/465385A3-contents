3.  **Graduate Research Assistant**,

    Worked for Professor [Shankar P Bhattacharyya](https://people.engr.tamu.edu/spb/index.html),

    Texas A&M University, College Station,

    January 2014 - May 2014.

    *Proposed a novel approach for determining controller gains of an automotive cruise controller. Used the method of signatures to determine a set of stabilizing gains for regulating speed. Implemented a least-squares algorithm, which determines appropriate gains from the stabilizing set based on specified performance indices. Published the work titled, "A novel approach to the design of controllers in an automotive cruise-control system.", in IECON'14.*
