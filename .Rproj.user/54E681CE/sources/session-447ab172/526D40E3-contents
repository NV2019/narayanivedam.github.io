Welcome to my page!

I am a Postdoctoral fellow at the **National University of Singapore** exploring the realm of human behaviour within online social platforms, and their manifestations in our day-to-day lives. My research, under the guidance of [Dr. Subhayan Mukerjee](https://www.subhayan.com/) at the Department of Communication and New Media, delves into the intricate dynamics of news consumption and the consequent emotional or attitudinal repercussions among partisan audience in online social platforms, using agent-based models as my primary tool.

Throughout my academic journey, I have been involved in various projects that employ computational methods to better understand, analyze and emulate human mannerisms, in both online and offline environments. One noteworthy endeavor focused on developing human-like automotive speed control systems, aiming to enhance driving experiences while ensuring safety. Additionally, I have explored group dynamics in virtual social platforms and its implications on opinion formation - consensus and dissensus. Furthermore, I have investigated the spread of diseases within communities, employing agent-based modeling techniques to simulate and analyze outbreak scenarios.

During my doctoral studies at **The Indian Institute of Science**, Bengaluru, I have developed models to understand social processes and generate insights that could assist real-world decision-makers. In particular, I worked on two social issues that could not be more relevant to prevailing times: opinion formation on virtual social platforms ([N.Vedam & D.Ghose, 2021](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9597470?casa_token=QEN815jnzIwAAAAA:smh-m-63gOX917nM1nczs7L7lXxY32BmH48hZtHR4VLqJ7ptYcBMpeYt1twnvtXrViRDewjGT6Fq)) and disease outbreaks ([N.Vedam & D.Ghose, 2022](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9817055?casa_token=hqyB45MSGq8AAAAA:e1qqJxHsGZwyu-tRXk8uGfa5qOKNWkkfpJwuI2AHCIxekfPrK6OfwSDE6cHVHXf5_cB4DSp4VGzO)).

Prior to my doctoral studies, I obtained my Master's degree from **Texas A&M University**, College Station. During this period, I developed a discrete dynamic programming algorithm in conjunction with a model predictive controller (MPC) ([N.Vedam, 2015](https://oaktrust.library.tamu.edu/handle/1969.1/156224)). This innovative fusion of human driving practices and the tracking abilities of conventional cruise controllers aimed to optimize driving performance and safety.

My work thus far has equipped me with a diverse skill set for employing cutting-edge computational approaches to understand social and behavioral phenomena. I am particularly interested in exploring top-down and bottom-up modeling approaches to gain comprehensive insights into the complexities of human behavior. By leveraging computational models, I aspire to contribute to the development of strategies and interventions that promote positive social interactions and enhance our understanding of the intricate relationships between individuals and their virtual communities.
