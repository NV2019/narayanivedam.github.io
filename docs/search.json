    "text": "Welcome to my page!\n\n\n\nI am a Postdoctoral fellow at the National University of Singapore, engaged in exploring the realm of human behaviour within online social platforms and their manifestations in our day-to-day lives. Under the guidance of Dr. Subhayan Mukerjee at the Department of Communication and New Media,, my research delves into the intricate dynamics of virtual and physical communities using agent-based models as my primary tool.\nThroughout my academic journey, I have been involved in various compelling projects that employ computational social science to better understand and analyze the interplay between human mannerisms in online environments and their societal impact. One noteworthy endeavor focused on developing human-like automotive speed control systems, aiming to enhance driving experiences while ensuring safety. Additionally, I have explored the fascinating phenomenon of opinion formation in virtual social platforms and its implications on public discourse. Furthermore, I have investigated the spread of diseases within communities, employing innovative modeling techniques to simulate and analyze outbreak scenarios.\nDuring my doctoral studies at The Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, I developed models to understand social processes and generate insights that could assist real-world decision-makers. In particular, I worked on two social issues that could not be more relevant to prevailing times: opinion formation on virtual social platforms (N.Vedam & D.Ghose, 2021) and disease outbreaks (N.Vedam & D.Ghose, 2022).\nPrior to my doctoral studies, I obtained my Master’s degree from Texas A&M University, College Station. During this period, I developed a pioneering discrete dynamic programming algorithm in conjunction with a model predictive controller (MPC) (N.Vedam, 2015). This innovative fusion of human driving practices and the tracking abilities of conventional cruise controllers aimed to optimize driving performance and safety.\nThrough my academic journey, I have acquired a diverse skill set and a deep passion for employing cutting-edge computational approaches to understand social and behavioral phenomena. I am particularly interested in exploring top-down and bottom-up modeling approaches to gain comprehensive insights into the complexities of human behavior. By leveraging computational models, I aspire to contribute to the development of strategies and interventions that promote positive social interactions and enhance our understanding of the intricate relationships between individuals and their virtual communities.\n\n\n\nLoading the data just for you."
