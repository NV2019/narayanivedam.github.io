    "text": "Welcome to my page!\n\n\n\nI am a Postdoctoral fellow at the National University of Singapore exploring the realm of human behaviour within online social platforms, and their manifestations in our day-to-day lives. My research, under the guidance of Dr. Subhayan Mukerjee at the Department of Communication and New Media, delves into the intricate dynamics of news consumption and the consequent emotional or attitudinal repercussions among partisan audience in online social platforms, using agent-based models as my primary tool.\nThroughout my academic journey, I have been involved in various projects that employ computational methods to better understand, analyze and emulate human mannerisms, in both online and offline environments. One noteworthy endeavor focused on developing human-like automotive speed control systems, aiming to enhance driving experiences while ensuring safety. Additionally, I have explored group dynamics in virtual social platforms and its implications on opinion formation - consensus and dissensus. Furthermore, I have investigated the spread of diseases within communities, employing agent-based modeling techniques to simulate and analyze outbreak scenarios.\n\nNews\n\n\n\nApril 2023: “Polarization without Echoes? An Agent-Based Framework for Modeling Affective Polarization under Exposure to Diverse Content” has been accepted for a poster presentation at IC2S2 in Copenhagen in July, 2023\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 2023: Started as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Department of Communication and New Media, National University of Singapore \n\n\n\n\nJune 2022: Successfully defended my doctoral thesis at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru\n\n\n\nDuring my doctoral studies at The Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, I have developed models to understand social processes and generate insights that could assist real-world decision-makers. In particular, I worked on two social issues that could not be more relevant to prevailing times: opinion formation on virtual social platforms (N.Vedam & D.Ghose, 2021) and disease outbreaks (N.Vedam & D.Ghose, 2022).\nPrior to my doctoral studies, I obtained my Master’s degree from Texas A&M University, College Station. During this period, I developed a discrete dynamic programming algorithm in conjunction with a model predictive controller (MPC) (N.Vedam, 2015). This innovative fusion of human driving practices and the tracking abilities of conventional cruise controllers aimed to optimize driving performance and safety.\n\n\n\n\nLoading the data just for you.\n\n\n\nThrough my academic journey, I have acquired a diverse skill set for employing cutting-edge computational approaches to understand social and behavioral phenomena. I am particularly interested in exploring top-down and bottom-up modeling approaches to gain comprehensive insights into the complexities of human behavior. By leveraging computational models, I aspire to contribute to the development of strategies and interventions that promote positive social interactions and enhance our understanding of the intricate relationships between individuals and their virtual communities."

Used the method of signatures to determine a set of stabilizing gains for regulating speed. Implemented a least-squares algorithm, which determines appropriate gains from the stabilizing set based on specified performance indices. Published the work titled, “A novel approach to the design of controllers in an automotive cruise-control system.”, in IECON’14."
